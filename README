This is a set of code used to practice what is taught at http://www.highercomputingforeveryone.com/.

It's being stored here as my own sandbox, so I'm not "supporting" it or providing help on how to compile or use it, but if you think it would help in your pursuit of learning while you read through the course yourself, you're welcome to it.
